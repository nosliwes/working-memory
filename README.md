# working-memory

The following code is a simple version of the distributed code at 
https://github.com/Lham71/Working-Memory-Modeling 

To run the program, navigate to the current code directory and 
enter python main.py at the command line.
 
It will run a single experiment for the parameters listed below.
 
Simply change any of the parameters below if you want to run a 
different experiment.

The code requires that the following files are located in the same 
location as main.py:
1. spm_task.py
2. train_force.py
3. posthoc_test.py
4. allDigCNNMNIST

The code also requires a results folder to save the results.

Please contact steven.wilson@ou.edu if you have questions or need
help with any of the code.
